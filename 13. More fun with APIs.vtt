00:00.270 --> 00:02.700
Let's look at some other AP eyes.

00:02.760 --> 00:06.630
Now some of them that you encounter will have these coures errors.

00:06.690 --> 00:14.130
So this one in particular the quotes on design doesn't work very well within local and you have to use

00:14.130 --> 00:16.150
the Jason P format here.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.320
So we're going to do is we're going to do this and build this out on code.

00:20.850 --> 00:28.110
I've stripped away a lot of what we had earlier within that application and I've brought in random user.

00:28.290 --> 00:32.350
So let's quickly look through this API and then we'll jump into cold pen.

00:32.430 --> 00:36.070
So we see that we're returning information back in results.

00:38.190 --> 00:43.290
So refresh and results is where the content is that we're looking at.

00:43.290 --> 00:49.080
And the same thing with the trivia database that we can break it down into data results.

00:49.190 --> 00:52.210
And then this is where all that information is that we're after.

00:52.260 --> 00:57.600
So we can really easily select any piece of this information and then output it and make use of it so

00:57.600 --> 01:01.190
we could do something like the name that first name.

01:01.290 --> 01:05.250
So we could do name and first

01:08.200 --> 01:12.080
and plus space space plus.

01:12.130 --> 01:15.320
And then the same thing again but this time writing last

01:18.240 --> 01:19.470
and the save that.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.090
So now within the console we get some random people's names.

01:23.370 --> 01:26.270
So it's as easy as that to work with different API.

01:26.400 --> 01:32.580
And as mentioned we want to look at the quote database and this one is a little bit more tricky when

01:32.580 --> 01:34.020
we're doing it within local.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.740
So we can't really easily bring in the quote information but is actually in a function.

01:39.930 --> 01:44.480
So we can see it when we go into the browser.

01:45.580 --> 01:46.610
So we do this.

01:46.720 --> 01:54.790
We see that we get random quotes but if I was to take that same you are l and if we just Konsole log

01:54.790 --> 01:59.430
out the data I'll comment this one.

01:59.450 --> 02:02.450
I will rewrite it there.

02:03.410 --> 02:12.320
So if we console log the data we're going to run into a coures error and we've got to start in that

02:12.320 --> 02:12.650
quote.

02:12.680 --> 02:20.450
So refresh and we see that what we're running into is this no access control header problem.

02:20.900 --> 02:27.440
And even if we try to parse it out as Jason we can see that we're still going to run into a problem.

02:27.440 --> 02:33.710
So let's bring this over into code Pentz open up code pen so-called pen is really useful as well for

02:33.710 --> 02:44.430
practicing with Ajax because this gets you around a lot of these problems so you can sign up for a pen.

02:44.450 --> 02:45.720
You don't have to pay anything.

02:45.740 --> 02:48.240
It's just all of your posts are public.

02:48.260 --> 02:50.510
If you do pay then they will be private.

02:50.540 --> 02:56.130
You can set up private posts as well so just call it Ajax.

02:56.240 --> 03:00.770
So let's add all of our h t m l.

03:00.940 --> 03:06.450
That's kind of one of the nice things about it is I can copy all of my body information so I don't have

03:06.450 --> 03:09.070
to split it off and put stuff in javascript.

03:10.060 --> 03:13.150
Of course there is that option there for the javascript as well.

03:14.980 --> 03:23.500
So let's see what happens when we click at and we'll see what we get output into the console and we

03:23.500 --> 03:25.130
need to also update.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.690
So this is the API value that we're grabbing

03:32.180 --> 03:33.780
So update our your all

03:38.000 --> 03:40.170
save and we'll try the soat

03:44.020 --> 03:50.000
and we can also use the regular cons. If we want.

03:50.240 --> 03:57.400
And so we're getting this mixed content issue because we're loading and secure data over secure.

03:57.770 --> 03:59.340
So that's always not great.

03:59.660 --> 04:01.040
So we get rid of that.

04:01.130 --> 04:07.480
We can see that we're actually grabbing that content.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.670
So we're getting it within a nice object format.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.170
So I took care of that problem.

04:11.200 --> 04:16.360
So that's another problem that sometimes you do run into because that's a good thing about code pen

04:16.710 --> 04:23.710
HTP s and some of the Web sites if you're trying to access them and if they're not secure then you can

04:23.710 --> 04:31.990
run into issues so you can just simply remove that HTP colon and just let it send whatever the best

04:31.990 --> 04:34.590
format is that it can pick that up.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.140
So there we go.

04:35.140 --> 04:40.540
So we're all ready to pull that content in and out put it in our output area.

04:41.050 --> 04:45.390
So let's actually move this all down to javascript.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.880
And separate it from our content there.

04:51.890 --> 04:56.930
And this is going to allow us to clean that up to tidy that up and make it a little bit bigger.

04:56.940 --> 05:00.100
I'll get rid of the console because we have it down below as well.

05:02.050 --> 05:04.520
So great so we're able to pick up this data.

05:04.570 --> 05:12.340
I can get rid of this console log stuff here and now what we can do is we can simply output that content

05:12.340 --> 05:16.680
that we're retrieving back.

05:16.690 --> 05:22.570
Let's first get rid of the parsing of Jason just to see if we can take a closer look at actually what's

05:22.570 --> 05:29.570
being returned back.

05:29.610 --> 05:33.340
So we see that it's being returned back within an array format.

05:33.990 --> 05:45.080
So when we parse it out as Jason we need to just simply return back that first item in the array.

05:45.120 --> 05:45.570
So there you go.

05:45.570 --> 05:54.950
So now we've got title content and we can output content into our output area and we already have that

05:54.980 --> 05:56.710
hooked up.

05:56.720 --> 06:02.440
So now it's just as easy as doing in her HVM mail.

06:03.050 --> 06:07.750
And now we know that data scenary.

06:08.410 --> 06:12.100
So if we don't get the content we just treated as an object

06:16.250 --> 06:17.630
so it happens so there we go.

06:17.660 --> 06:20.820
So we can really easily pull in that content.

06:21.470 --> 06:25.010
And then of course at this point we can style it and do even more.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.650
So we see that it's already got a little bit of styling there as well to it

06:31.500 --> 06:34.100
and obviously you can play around with it.

06:34.110 --> 06:38.960
But the main purpose of this lesson was to get more familiar with just different ways of working with

06:38.970 --> 06:39.630
API.

06:39.870 --> 06:44.120
Overcoming issues you might have with API it's very when you're working on local.

06:44.400 --> 06:51.090
You do run into those issues occasionally when you don't have control over what the server and passing

06:51.090 --> 06:53.800
it in over the Jaison data.

06:53.800 --> 06:59.880
So sometimes you do run into those cores as well as sometimes you run into those HTP errors as well.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.790
So go ahead try it for yourself.

07:01.800 --> 07:07.860
I'm going to go ahead and save this pen so you can go online and you could work with it and try it out

07:07.860 --> 07:08.570
for yourself.
