00:00.330 --> 00:06.540
The previous lesson we set up our Ajax request and we can see that all of that information is being

00:06.540 --> 00:08.280
retrieved whenever we click the button.

00:08.370 --> 00:10.440
We're going through all the different states.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.390
And then finally at the 4th ready state.

00:12.420 --> 00:19.450
We've got some response text so it's not our condition in order to check all of the different ready

00:19.500 --> 00:26.310
States and wait till we hit number four before we try to retrieve our data.

00:26.310 --> 00:29.580
Also we want to make sure our status is 200.

00:30.210 --> 00:37.290
So sh our status and we're going to check to see if it's 200 and if it is at that point then we're ready

00:37.290 --> 00:44.310
to console log out and we're actually ready to return back our data or response text.

00:44.460 --> 00:52.460
So we're going to grab it's actually our response text so we grab the value of that and we see that

00:52.530 --> 00:54.920
we got a ton of text coming back there.

00:54.990 --> 00:59.490
So this isn't just on format it even though it is within a song format.

00:59.490 --> 01:00.330
It's still a string.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.450
It's still taxed.

01:01.530 --> 01:08.970
So the way to update this is we can parse it out as Jason so we can do Jason parse the javascript function

01:08.970 --> 01:14.100
that gives us the ability to parse sote string formatted Jaison.

01:14.100 --> 01:20.550
So let's click and so now we can see that we've got results and we've got a number of different results

01:20.550 --> 01:24.260
here within this API.

01:24.400 --> 01:30.880
So we've got categories we've got trivia questions here so incorrect answers.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.310
So we've got a question.

01:32.530 --> 01:36.960
We've got the correct answer is true and difficulty is easy.

01:36.970 --> 01:38.390
And that's the category.

01:38.440 --> 01:44.680
So it can really easily set up a quick mini trivia game where we can see if the user is able to guess

01:44.740 --> 01:46.230
all of those answers.

01:46.510 --> 01:49.290
So let's set up this data in a usable format.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.350
Opening up our editor open up full screen so we can take a closer look.

01:53.350 --> 01:58.690
So we saw that we're passing through this you are l but we still have a problem that that content is

01:58.690 --> 02:04.990
being output within this function and we can't do something like return if we do that then we're actually

02:04.990 --> 02:08.130
not going to capture that correct information.

02:08.140 --> 02:14.880
So this is where we need to do a callback because this Ajax request is working asynchronously.

02:14.920 --> 02:23.020
So what's happening here is that the ready States making that connection to the API and it's waiting

02:23.020 --> 02:24.850
till the ready state is ready.

02:24.850 --> 02:28.210
So until the status is 200 to output that text.

02:28.390 --> 02:32.930
So if we immediately try to return it back then we're not going to get any type of response.

02:32.950 --> 02:38.440
So this is where we need to do a callback and we can do it within a format of a callback function.

02:38.440 --> 02:44.380
So the way that this is going to work is that we're going to actually pass through a function and when

02:44.410 --> 02:48.490
we do get some data that we can make use of it within our function.

02:48.490 --> 02:52.600
So here is where we can console log that data.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.220
So this is essentially that returned information.

02:56.530 --> 03:01.710
And then within here let's set up callback and start a console log.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.990
This is going into the callback function.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.060
So let's try the suit.

03:06.100 --> 03:09.460
So we're Konsole logging the data the return data.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.130
At this point now we can get rid of the clicked.

03:12.130 --> 03:13.210
We don't need that anymore.

03:14.950 --> 03:19.080
And just make sure that we are getting the callback information.

03:19.150 --> 03:19.700
So there we go.

03:19.720 --> 03:25.240
So that is working properly and now we're ready to loop through this information and build out our quiz

03:25.240 --> 03:25.770
game.

03:25.780 --> 03:27.000
So that's coming up next.
