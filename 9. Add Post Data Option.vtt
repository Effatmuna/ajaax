00:00.780 --> 00:04.460
All right we are ready to add in posts.

00:04.470 --> 00:07.600
So right now everything is working as expected.

00:07.620 --> 00:13.410
We've got all four each x methods hooked up and ready to go in our test drop location.

00:13.410 --> 00:19.260
So now let's update this and add in the ability to select different methods.

00:19.260 --> 00:27.060
So we want to keep the ability to do that to select the resource but we also want the user to be able

00:27.060 --> 00:30.070
to select a method.

00:30.540 --> 00:33.990
So we give it an ID and we'll call it method.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.160
And then here let's add in some options.

00:38.190 --> 00:45.870
So first option value is going to be get and we're going to make this one selected and then the next

00:45.960 --> 00:47.870
option value we've got.

00:47.870 --> 00:56.680
Post of course and this way we give the user the option to select GET or POST.

00:57.990 --> 01:02.530
And typically with post we want to send some data over as well.

01:02.550 --> 01:04.050
So let's take care of that.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.820
So we need some additional fields here.

01:07.050 --> 01:18.900
So input type text and maybe this can be first or something like that will just give it a name for a

01:18.900 --> 01:21.400
first name or whatever we want to call it.

01:24.780 --> 01:29.040
And next let's add an input type text.

01:29.340 --> 01:36.550
And this one is going to be let's give it a number.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.960
And of course we know that with inputs they're strings anyway.

01:41.490 --> 01:45.510
We don't need to have a submit button because we're just going to be grabbing all of the form data.

01:45.630 --> 01:50.700
So it actually doesn't matter how many fields you have here how many input fields we're going to serialize

01:50.700 --> 01:55.720
them and send them over make use of them within our posts also.

01:55.950 --> 02:02.250
So we've got our button there and we need to make some updates to this meek request function as well

02:02.490 --> 02:05.550
because now we've got some more parameters there to look at.

02:05.580 --> 02:10.940
So we just added in two more parameters.

02:11.220 --> 02:25.960
So let's grab our method so documents and query selector and this time let's make sure we hash it because

02:26.200 --> 02:27.160
we give it an ID

02:30.110 --> 02:31.080
value.

02:31.580 --> 02:33.890
And also we've got some form data.

02:33.890 --> 02:46.080
So we're going to do form and we're going to use the javascript form data object so form data and we

02:46.080 --> 02:49.380
also need to specify where we're getting this data from.

02:49.380 --> 02:52.490
So the element that we're picking that up from.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.730
So let's do that as well.

02:53.730 --> 03:05.210
So I just I gave it a quick name there let's do a document query selector and we only have the one form

03:05.600 --> 03:08.510
we could actually give it an ID maybe to be more specific

03:11.980 --> 03:14.200
and update that over here as well.

03:14.200 --> 03:25.280
So life form sort of grabbing that entire object and we're using the javascript form data to format

03:25.280 --> 03:28.130
that within a data format that we can send over.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.550
So next what we want to do so we've got all of this working

03:34.220 --> 03:41.050
and we can send over the URL and we've got some more parameters to send over as well.

03:41.210 --> 03:48.620
So we also have our method and we also have our form information and all three of these parameters we're

03:48.620 --> 03:50.810
sending over and each one of the cases

03:54.350 --> 03:57.710
and the Dow now down within these functions.

03:57.710 --> 03:59.460
This is where we got to make use of them.

03:59.660 --> 04:03.520
So we've got to update some of our codes so let's take it one by one.

04:03.530 --> 04:08.180
So the first one that we're updating Let's update our javascript first

04:11.010 --> 04:17.420
so we've got fetch a X-ers G query and this is the one that we want to update

04:20.220 --> 04:30.510
so within that javascript just plain javascript object we need to check to see if it's a post or if

04:30.510 --> 04:31.370
it's a get.

04:31.710 --> 04:35.710
And the only difference here is going to be the way that we send this method.

04:35.820 --> 04:42.980
So let's check to see if method is equal to get.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.870
And if it is equal to get then we can just do the one that we used already.

04:50.950 --> 04:56.380
And we can also let's also keep send in there as well.

04:56.620 --> 05:03.820
It doesn't actually matter if you were to to add the data to send the data in a GET request.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.080
It doesn't actually matter.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.780
But for this case we're just separate them.

05:08.320 --> 05:09.730
And in this case

05:12.460 --> 05:19.770
that means that it's a post and for a post we're going to format it as post and then we've got our form

05:19.890 --> 05:22.200
information that we're going to send with in there.

05:22.660 --> 05:23.910
So that's the only difference.

05:23.920 --> 05:24.900
So that's it.

05:24.940 --> 05:29.260
And we can also check to see status.

05:29.260 --> 05:34.210
So let's break this up because the status when we post is going to be two old Once it's not going to

05:34.210 --> 05:35.550
be 200.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.670
So let's break this one up as well.

05:39.550 --> 05:51.380
So we know that if it's ready state for that we can do our check and let's add an else if and we're

05:51.380 --> 06:00.440
going at this time we'll check to see if the ex-teachers status is to a one and if it is then we can

06:00.440 --> 06:04.970
say I did and everything else can stay the same.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.630
And then lastly let's do one more else.

06:12.490 --> 06:15.310
And over here is if we have an error.

06:15.420 --> 06:23.460
So this is if we made the connection but we didn't have a status of 200 and we didn't have a status

06:23.550 --> 06:26.850
of two or one that we know that we threw an error.

06:26.850 --> 06:32.770
So this is going to be basically our fail or we can just call it javascript error.

06:35.730 --> 06:42.690
So let's clean up the code and go out to the browser and let's try this out.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.550
So we've got one problem there already.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.940
So we've got too many brackets here.

06:57.450 --> 06:59.110
And let's try that again.

06:59.220 --> 07:01.230
As a matter of too many of the brackets

07:03.980 --> 07:06.180
so it's do javascript post.

07:06.180 --> 07:06.790
So there we go.

07:06.810 --> 07:10.640
So we posted and this time I notice that it says create it.

07:10.650 --> 07:14.090
So if I switch that back to get we don't have to create it.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.210
So it is taking it as a post.

07:16.380 --> 07:22.310
And when I do post we can see that we've got javascript added.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.660
We've got the tool one we've got created.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.820
So all of that is being sent through properly.

07:27.930 --> 07:35.310
So the other thing that we can do as well is we can hook up the other libraries and fetch in order to

07:35.310 --> 07:36.780
do posts as well.

07:36.930 --> 07:39.040
So that's coming up in the next lesson.

07:39.090 --> 07:45.840
So for now we've got quite a few updates that we've made to our input form as well as we've updated

07:45.960 --> 07:47.210
that javascript

07:51.580 --> 07:55.190
in order to respond to the get and posts.

07:55.270 --> 07:58.070
So go ahead and make those updates as well.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.890
And coming up I going to show even more cool things that you can do.

08:02.020 --> 08:06.980
And we're going to update the posts in the other methods as well.

08:08.660 --> 08:12.930
We're going to update the posts in the other Ajax formats as well.

08:12.950 --> 08:13.610
So it's coming up.
