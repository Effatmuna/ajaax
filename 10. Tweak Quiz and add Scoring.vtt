00:00.880 --> 00:06.570
This is going to be the fun part of the lessons because here is where we go over the code.

00:06.610 --> 00:10.930
Make sure everything's working and apply some final tweaks to the code.

00:10.930 --> 00:15.960
So first of all let's go and open up her application and try to see how it's functioning.

00:16.060 --> 00:20.400
And take a quick look over to make sure that there aren't any issues.

00:20.470 --> 00:22.800
So there are a number of things that we still need to do.

00:22.870 --> 00:32.090
And one of them is that we need to add in some type of class or some type of way to distinguish that

00:32.180 --> 00:36.750
these divs are buttons so we can do that within styling.

00:37.010 --> 00:46.700
We could add classes as well but to keep things simple what we'll do is we'll grab the elements by id

00:50.190 --> 00:53.950
and over here we're going to.

00:55.140 --> 00:59.540
So all of the divs that are underneath so any div that we have in there.

00:59.580 --> 01:02.640
So you got to be careful not to add any additional divs.

01:03.480 --> 01:12.930
So do border solid will do a block border add some padding around it to make it look a little bit more

01:12.930 --> 01:14.110
like a button.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.760
And also some margin's around it as well.

01:19.940 --> 01:22.610
So they're not right next to each other so see what this looks like.

01:22.610 --> 01:32.090
Now we should also to display and would try inline block see how that works.

01:34.450 --> 01:35.050
So there you go.

01:35.050 --> 01:38.660
So now we have something that actually looks a little bit more like buttons.

01:38.740 --> 01:42.640
And of course I'm sure you could style this way better than what I'm doing.

01:42.730 --> 01:45.820
But we're looking at functionality more than anything right now.

01:45.970 --> 01:49.190
So we've got our buttons and we've got the ability to click these.

01:49.240 --> 01:55.750
And so ideally what should have actually happened here is that we should get it either right or wrong

01:56.020 --> 01:59.880
and then move on to the next question maybe update the score.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.150
So let's try that at.

02:03.170 --> 02:07.440
So we know that we've got the answer either true or false.

02:07.460 --> 02:13.160
So let's do a check to see if Which one is true and which one is false.

02:15.190 --> 02:20.720
So we've got this value that's coming in and let me.

02:20.740 --> 02:26.760
Let me place this within on a variable so we can work with it a little bit easier.

02:26.770 --> 02:28.710
We don't need it within the console at the moment.

02:28.880 --> 02:34.460
So yes and if it's equal to true then we know we've got a correct answer.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.130
And we do something here.

02:36.130 --> 02:39.160
Otherwise we know that the answer is incorrect.

02:39.340 --> 02:41.890
And then we do something else.

02:41.950 --> 02:45.300
So what we can do is we could do answers

02:47.840 --> 02:54.760
and let me or answers wrong it should be.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.430
And that one is going to increment otherwise.

02:57.430 --> 03:00.580
So if we get it wrong then our score will change.

03:00.580 --> 03:02.230
So it's a lot less that we need to do.

03:02.230 --> 03:08.800
We need to update our score so we can simply grab that score.

03:08.890 --> 03:16.840
We're going to get element by ID document get element by id and that's score

03:19.690 --> 03:21.950
and we can do in inner age to Mel

03:24.510 --> 03:27.330
and not enter each to Mel so we can do

03:29.840 --> 03:37.690
correct and then we'll add in that value for correct and we'll also do wrong.

03:39.430 --> 03:44.250
And again I'm sure you could make it look a whole lot nicer than what I'm doing.

03:45.280 --> 03:51.480
So we're just looking at functionality at this point and don't spend too much time on the styling.

03:51.490 --> 03:54.500
So let's try the soat.

03:54.820 --> 04:00.040
So every time we get it wrong you see the wrong is increasing every time we get it right the correct

04:00.040 --> 04:01.180
is increasing.

04:01.180 --> 04:08.500
So what we need to do is we need to maybe get rid of these selections and output whether it's right

04:08.500 --> 04:12.420
or wrong within there so we can actually even select anything else.

04:14.270 --> 04:21.020
We could also look through these elements and see which one is has an attribute of true and we could

04:21.020 --> 04:24.020
return that as the correct value if we want it to.

04:24.170 --> 04:29.680
Or we could hold the correct value within the div as well within an attribute.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.380
So let's do the latter part.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.950
So next let's add in a little bit more functionality into this.

04:34.950 --> 04:38.260
And also we can really easily just apply some styling.

04:38.370 --> 04:47.470
So the category doesn't have to be big within the styling so font size and this one will make fairly

04:47.470 --> 04:47.920
small

04:50.970 --> 04:53.670
and for the question I want to make that pretty big.

04:53.880 --> 04:54.880
So let's.

04:57.050 --> 05:04.290
And so font size for this one is going to be 1.5.

05:04.360 --> 05:05.900
So make it pretty vague.

05:06.010 --> 05:15.250
So they're going to be different there so our question and we probably don't even need this question

05:15.250 --> 05:16.160
thing here.

05:16.540 --> 05:20.800
We can get rid of that so we can clear that out.

05:23.400 --> 05:29.730
So we've got our score and by default we should have a score value that matches with what we're outputting

05:29.730 --> 05:30.440
here.

05:30.720 --> 05:31.320
Wrong.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.850
Zero.

05:34.050 --> 05:39.140
And really truly there's a lot of ways to style this way better.

05:39.160 --> 05:43.070
So where we are ready to move on to the next step.

05:43.210 --> 05:48.330
So go ahead and add these updates into your code.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.860
And next you can also take some more time style it make it look a little bit better.

05:53.990 --> 06:01.430
And next we're going to tweak it so that whenever the user selects an answer that we provide what the

06:01.430 --> 06:02.300
correct answer was.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.590
So it's coming up next.
