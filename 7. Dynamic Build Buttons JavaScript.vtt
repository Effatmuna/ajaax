00:00.280 --> 00:05.910
In the previous lesson we saw how we can get the questions how we can put them in h t m l and now it's

00:05.910 --> 00:12.390
time to ask and build out the buttons and then we can attach the scoring and complete our application.

00:12.390 --> 00:14.570
So this is working properly.

00:14.610 --> 00:17.490
We see we're getting all of this information being returned.

00:17.490 --> 00:18.880
We've got correct answer.

00:18.960 --> 00:26.000
We've got incorrect answers so we can basically build out an array with correct and incorrect answers.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.190
And that way we can build the buttons.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.620
We have enough content to build out those buttons.

00:30.750 --> 00:38.180
So we are missing one thing and that's an output area in our HD M-L to load our button content.

00:38.220 --> 00:42.530
So I'm going to create that now so select and we'll just call it select answers

00:46.010 --> 00:47.330
and we'll leave that blank.

00:47.660 --> 00:57.600
So let's go into our H.T. Amelle Let's go into our javascript and build the set.

00:57.620 --> 01:02.290
So last time we left off building out our H.T. a mail object.

01:02.360 --> 01:08.240
So now we're ready to update that and we can leave that in the next part of it is to build out a function

01:08.300 --> 01:10.780
that's actually going to add and build buttons.

01:10.790 --> 01:12.440
So let's set that up.

01:12.440 --> 01:22.820
So we'll call it question builder and we'll take in a few parameters we'll get the correct and incorrect

01:22.910 --> 01:24.070
values.

01:24.140 --> 01:30.520
So it's going to be passed into there and then over here we just need to simply output that.

01:30.540 --> 01:31.960
So let's do a question.

01:31.980 --> 01:36.300
Builder and passing that information.

01:36.310 --> 01:38.650
So we've got it within an object format.

01:38.650 --> 01:41.460
We've got the correct answer.

01:42.130 --> 01:44.440
Underscore answer.

01:44.710 --> 01:54.180
And then we also have an array of incorrect answers and this one is answers so it's plural and we need

01:54.180 --> 01:58.110
to attach that object to it as well.

01:58.110 --> 02:00.900
So we go through object incorrect answers.

02:01.020 --> 02:05.190
And this is where we're going to build out the question because we need to attach event listeners to

02:05.190 --> 02:05.660
this.

02:05.730 --> 02:09.620
So we can't do it in a simple to M-L because it doesn't always work great.

02:09.660 --> 02:13.950
And then we'd have to run and loop through and add all of our listeners.

02:13.950 --> 02:15.510
That doesn't always work really well.

02:15.530 --> 02:20.490
We have to build out those elements within javascript and loop through them.

02:22.870 --> 02:27.870
So now that we're getting this information passed in let's create an array we'll just call it Holder

02:28.600 --> 02:32.450
and this survey is going to get the incorrect values.

02:32.950 --> 02:40.360
And for now let's just console log out that Holder array and this is what we're actually going to work

02:40.360 --> 02:41.830
with.

02:41.980 --> 02:46.220
So let's refresh and see how Sierre check out our progress.

02:46.240 --> 02:49.960
So click the button and we build out an array.

02:50.440 --> 02:54.730
So right now these are all true or false.

02:54.910 --> 03:00.700
And we'll get rid of the boolean value type so you can also specify that within the object so they could

03:00.700 --> 03:04.010
be true or false or they could be multiple choice.

03:04.150 --> 03:07.620
So it actually doesn't matter because either way we can build out there.

03:07.780 --> 03:12.140
And notice that we do have one thing missing in the array and that's the correct answer.

03:12.160 --> 03:19.510
So let's add that one and we can really easily add that in with javascript's So we've got holder using

03:19.510 --> 03:20.370
push.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.550
And then here is where we specify that correct answer.

03:24.550 --> 03:25.850
So we'll add that one in.

03:25.930 --> 03:29.730
So click.

03:29.730 --> 03:30.200
So there we go.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.190
So we've got the correct answer.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.360
Add it in along with the incorrect answers.

03:38.340 --> 03:41.210
And now let's sort that array.

03:41.580 --> 03:42.930
So you can also add in

03:45.940 --> 03:48.660
an array shuffle or something like that as well.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.930
So for now we're going to keep it really simple we're just going to sort the array.

03:51.940 --> 03:56.500
So the correct answer always isn't the last one because in this case it is.

03:56.740 --> 03:58.110
So we don't want that to happen.

03:58.120 --> 04:02.760
We want to have a little bit of a randomising and make it a little bit harder for users to guess.

04:02.770 --> 04:06.130
So what it's going to do now it's just going to sort it in alphabetical order.

04:06.250 --> 04:11.500
So just to keep things simple and of course you can add that in functionality and at a later point to

04:11.500 --> 04:13.790
randomize the order of the array.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.290
So let's try that out now.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.720
So refresh.

04:18.300 --> 04:23.070
So this time the correct answer shouldn't always be at the end.

04:23.070 --> 04:25.690
In that case it was this case.

04:25.710 --> 04:27.790
Correct answer is the third one.

04:27.990 --> 04:28.680
So that's great.

04:28.680 --> 04:34.880
So next we're ready to actually to add this into our H.T. amount.

04:34.880 --> 04:40.760
So let's create an object in order to hold that element data.

04:40.800 --> 04:48.060
So a get element by id and the name of the elements was what answer.

04:48.060 --> 04:52.200
So grab that there just to make sure that we are grabbing the right one.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.910
And it was select answers.

04:55.380 --> 04:58.090
So it's always good to double check those element names.

04:58.300 --> 05:02.550
And what we want to do first off is we want to clear that out.

05:03.060 --> 05:08.950
So let's set that in or h t m l and we'll just set it to blank to clear it out to empty it.

05:09.450 --> 05:14.130
And I know we don't have anything in there but we are going to be adding all of the buttons and we don't

05:14.130 --> 05:19.200
want the buttons to continuously build up there so we want to clear that out when we get the opportunity.

05:20.940 --> 05:26.940
So the thing that we need to add in here as well is we want to add in a function that's going to fire

05:26.940 --> 05:33.890
off whenever the user clicks one of these buttons and it's going to send the answer or check the answer.

05:35.410 --> 05:40.400
And we're going to grab the information set it up as an attribute.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.880
So for now let's just log out that event.

05:44.040 --> 05:54.040
Target and this and Javascript will simply because we're adding an event listener to these elements

05:54.550 --> 05:59.790
we can use event target to grab whatever element initiated that event.

06:01.380 --> 06:03.310
We're not having any problems there's no issues.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.140
So we're ready to go on to the next lesson.

06:05.310 --> 06:08.660
So add this into your application using your editor.

06:08.820 --> 06:16.890
And next lesson we're going to create that dynamically create the buttons with the answers that the

06:16.890 --> 06:17.760
user can select.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.880
So that's coming up.
