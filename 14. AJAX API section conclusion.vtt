In the earlier lessons we saw how we can build out a quiz application from scratch just connecting to

00:06.780 --> 00:08.550
an API.

00:08.570 --> 00:09.800
It's now it's up to you.

00:09.860 --> 00:11.150
There's a number of different API.

00:11.150 --> 00:12.290
So they're on the web.

00:12.320 --> 00:17.840
There's a Star Wars API for instance that can pull information about Star Wars people.

00:17.950 --> 00:24.470
So we've got information about Luke Skywalker height mass blond hair skin color and so on.

00:24.500 --> 00:30.770
So you can make use of these various API is try them out and pull in that data and then output that

00:30.770 --> 00:32.410
data within your web page.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.890
There's also the random user api.

00:34.930 --> 00:36.480
So there's another really good one.

00:36.580 --> 00:39.480
I'm just going to listed in here as commented.

00:39.800 --> 00:45.620
So you could really easily just swap these out and try out different API is here and there's a number

00:45.620 --> 00:47.550
of ways to customize this.

00:47.550 --> 00:53.390
You can go into vehicles you have to go people you could go planets and you see all the information

00:53.390 --> 00:54.850
that gets returned back.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.720
You can just do planets by itself.

00:57.830 --> 01:00.330
And that's going to list out a whole count of them.

01:02.950 --> 01:08.150
So if you want to practice looping through multiple values you can do that as well here.

01:08.170 --> 01:13.550
So you've got results and then you can loop through all of those results as well.

01:13.600 --> 01:20.020
So go ahead try this for yourself and you can also see that there's a follow up page so page to page

01:20.020 --> 01:26.370
3 so you can practice looping through all the different pages as well and build the sauteing your application.

01:26.410 --> 01:27.350
Try it out.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.660
Practice working with Ajax and the various API that are online.

01:31.700 --> 01:34.200
You can always google for additional API.

01:34.420 --> 01:40.090
If you do run into some problems go out and try it out on code pen and see if that fixes any of the

01:40.090 --> 01:42.640
coures issues that you might be having locally.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.350
So they don't all work locally.

01:44.440 --> 01:50.590
So that's just a word of advice and some of them do need some type of authentication or token or a key.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.900
So always keep that in mind as well.

01:52.900 --> 01:58.300
So unless you've actually created the API you don't really have a whole lot of control on accessing

01:58.300 --> 02:00.170
it and making use for it.

02:00.190 --> 02:03.720
So you have to go through and filter through ones that work.

02:03.730 --> 02:10.540
So always try it first before you go through the trouble of building out all of the coding and try it

02:10.540 --> 02:15.190
out because it doesn't mean that necessarily if it works in your browser it's going to also work within

02:15.190 --> 02:16.690
your local application.

02:16.720 --> 02:23.410
So try it out first create a really simple Ajax request however you are l and then simply try it out

02:23.410 --> 02:25.060
and see if you can return the data.

02:25.060 --> 02:29.110
And if you can return the data then you're all good to continue to build the application

02:31.630 --> 02:38.140
also continue to practice with Ajax pulling in data and outputting it within your web page.
