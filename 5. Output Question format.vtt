00:00.640 --> 00:04.220
Last lesson we saw how we can retrieve data from the API.

00:04.260 --> 00:07.770
Now we need to make use of this data and output it within our team.

00:08.030 --> 00:13.920
So let's open up our editor and update some or H-2 else we have our output area.

00:13.950 --> 00:14.940
We have a score.

00:15.030 --> 00:23.950
We have a button to move to the next one we need to also grab that output area into a usable format.

00:23.950 --> 00:33.780
So an object will just to get element by Id grab that output element into the value of output.

00:33.910 --> 00:37.720
And now we can also make use of the results here.

00:37.750 --> 00:45.340
So let's set up a variable and call it OPG and I'm going to basically place this value in so I don't

00:45.340 --> 00:51.350
have to keep rewriting it and we can also build out our H.T. m-L.

00:51.620 --> 00:52.280
So we.

00:52.280 --> 00:59.590
So we've got our h t m l and then what we want to do is build out what our channel is going to look

00:59.590 --> 01:00.610
like.

01:01.390 --> 01:08.130
So and here we just simply have to do H-2 mile plus plus equals.

01:08.260 --> 01:14.860
And then here is where we can build out like if we needed a div which we should probably wrap it with

01:14.860 --> 01:18.530
a div and close it so we build Dahdah it.

01:19.120 --> 01:26.240
And then lastly we do output in our h t m l equals H2 you know.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.180
So we simply output that content.

01:28.360 --> 01:29.910
So first of all let's try the suit.

01:29.950 --> 01:31.480
So no we've made some changes.

01:31.510 --> 01:36.880
It's always a good idea to constantly check in case you get some errors so see that we did get one error

01:36.910 --> 01:38.400
there being thrown.

01:38.740 --> 01:44.510
So what happened here is I when I copied and pasted I kept that extra rounded bracket in there.

01:44.540 --> 01:45.740
So now we go to the console.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.080
So everything is working.

01:47.110 --> 01:49.220
We've got our question popping up.

01:49.330 --> 01:50.320
We can load more.

01:50.380 --> 01:51.740
So everything is still working.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.690
So now we need to break this up.

01:53.710 --> 01:57.330
Some of this content we see that we've got categories.

01:57.430 --> 02:04.360
So it's probably a good place to start that we can create a div in here give it a class let's call it

02:04.360 --> 02:05.620
cat for short.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.820
And then this is where we're going to drop our category.

02:09.940 --> 02:14.710
And then here now we can do object category.

02:14.770 --> 02:18.350
So what other information do we need.

02:18.490 --> 02:26.540
And let's separate the soat and these like to just double check and make sure it's still working.

02:28.840 --> 02:34.930
So load more and let's take a look at our age to out just make sure that it's always building it out

02:34.930 --> 02:35.990
properly.

02:36.040 --> 02:40.510
So I've got our question and we've got our category that is working.

02:40.510 --> 02:46.720
So next thing that we might want to do is we want to put the question obviously so we need to have somewhere

02:46.720 --> 02:49.650
to output that for the users.

02:49.690 --> 03:00.590
So give us one class Quest's and close it off close off the div and then in here we can add in the question

03:00.590 --> 03:02.200
for the user.

03:02.270 --> 03:06.530
The first thing I usually like to do is just build out what it's going to look like and then do the

03:06.530 --> 03:07.750
styling afterwards.

03:07.760 --> 03:14.470
So I'm just adding in a lot of the IT KIND OF US placeholders for the styling and let's clean this up

03:14.470 --> 03:15.030
a bit.

03:18.740 --> 03:22.290
So close that one off we'll start a brand new line there.

03:25.030 --> 03:28.300
So we also need to listo it.

03:29.020 --> 03:36.010
So we've got the category we've got the question and we could also list out the difficulty if we wanted

03:36.010 --> 03:39.020
to or we could score differently for difficulty.

03:39.370 --> 03:40.820
So next in that we need.

03:41.140 --> 03:44.780
So let me just refresh I know I've got the question there twice.

03:44.990 --> 03:52.750
And what we need to do is we need to give the user some options some buttons to click and if we take

03:52.750 --> 03:54.870
a look at the way this is structured.

03:54.940 --> 04:02.770
So we've got this multiple here that allows us to determine what type of questioners.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.020
So let's build this out.

04:04.060 --> 04:08.890
And what I want to do is I want to create a function that's actually going to build this out and return

04:08.890 --> 04:13.730
back the H2 M-L for it because we know that we've got the correct answer.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.730
And then we've got some optional incorrect answers.

04:19.290 --> 04:20.830
So let's set that up.

04:21.120 --> 04:24.450
And in the next lesson we take care of that we're going to have a function.

04:24.660 --> 04:30.450
And this is going to be the question builder.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.350
So really question builder.

04:32.430 --> 04:38.160
But you get the idea and what it's going to do is it's going to return the format at HMO.

04:38.310 --> 04:40.920
So we're going to pass in the possible options.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.880
We're going to pass an incorrect and correct.

04:44.130 --> 04:48.520
All within within two different values.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.940
And then we'll loop through it.

04:49.970 --> 04:54.410
So we're going to check to see if the type is multiple and if it is then we know we need to build out

04:54.440 --> 04:56.190
our questions in this type of format.

04:56.420 --> 04:57.650
So all of that is coming up.
