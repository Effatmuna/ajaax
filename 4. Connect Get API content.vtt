00:01.100 --> 00:09.560
Last lesson we set up our Ajax request function and we're returning back the response data.

00:10.490 --> 00:15.740
So in this particular API we're going to try to pull out the results information so we don't need to

00:15.770 --> 00:17.030
look at any of the other stuff.

00:17.030 --> 00:19.510
We just need results.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.710
So let's make sure that we're looping through and we're pulling all of the results out.

00:23.810 --> 00:25.520
So notice that it's within a range.

00:25.670 --> 00:30.590
So we can loop through those results and then output those within our application.

00:30.590 --> 00:37.250
So let's set that up and let's also take a closer look at some of the data that's being returned back.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.610
So we've got categories entertainment correct answer.

00:41.840 --> 00:46.700
So we've got a number of different options here for the answer or we could do like a true or false.

00:46.700 --> 00:50.130
I think some of them are true or false.

00:50.210 --> 00:53.420
So these are all multiple choice.

00:53.520 --> 00:57.720
It's important to look through the data to make sure that you can accommodate it within the application

00:57.790 --> 00:59.530
as you're designing it.

00:59.710 --> 01:04.200
So we see that there's a number of incorrect answers that we need to provide.

01:04.240 --> 01:09.640
So we would have to pull this information back loop through it and output it for the user to be able

01:09.640 --> 01:18.410
to see and we can also query just each individual question or we could pull them all in and have a little

01:18.410 --> 01:19.640
mini application.

01:19.730 --> 01:25.280
But in this case it's going to make more sense if we simply pull back one and then every time the user

01:25.280 --> 01:29.480
wants another question then we simply pull out that question.

01:29.480 --> 01:34.730
So it's going to make it a lot more make a lot more sense within this type of project and we see that

01:34.790 --> 01:40.550
we've got questions and we've got correct answer is true.

01:40.550 --> 01:47.410
So sometimes the format is different so this one is a boolean value and this time it's a multiple choice

01:48.190 --> 01:49.210
type question.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.930
So we know with Boolean that we don't have incorrect answers.

01:52.930 --> 01:55.620
We just have the correct answer which is true or false.

01:55.810 --> 01:59.290
So the correct answer is always within that same format but these are changing.

01:59.290 --> 02:01.690
So we have to keep that in mind as well.

02:01.870 --> 02:06.090
And with this we simply we know that it's within an array format.

02:06.130 --> 02:09.010
So we just want to return back that first item.

02:09.040 --> 02:15.300
So there we go so we've got our basic structure of the question and we're ready to start building this

02:15.580 --> 02:19.160
within our reach to Mel.

02:19.290 --> 02:24.540
So let's create a div given an ID of output.

02:24.660 --> 02:27.450
So this is where our content will go.

02:27.450 --> 02:34.040
We also need another one for is going to give this one an idea of score.

02:34.770 --> 02:37.040
So we need to track that.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.680
Correct.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.310
So we're going to create an object here.

02:42.350 --> 02:46.610
And so one one value here will be correct.

02:47.150 --> 02:54.190
And currently this value is going to be zero and comma separated out and this one will just call wrong

02:55.590 --> 02:58.570
could call it incorrect as well.

02:58.570 --> 03:01.170
So that's going to give us some information for the scoring.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.200
Let's open up a little bit bigger as well.

03:04.660 --> 03:07.150
So we can take a closer look at some of this code.

03:07.450 --> 03:10.250
So we've got a global variable called answers.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.340
So this is basically going to keep score.

03:12.520 --> 03:17.590
We've got the output that we're going to generate every time the user clicks the button to get more

03:17.590 --> 03:22.170
questions and we're going to actually move the button down the low.

03:22.540 --> 03:28.130
So we've got the sclera the top we've got the output below that.

03:28.390 --> 03:33.770
And then the content there and I'm also going to update this as well.

03:34.140 --> 03:37.950
So that way we have essentially a placeholder for the score.

03:38.040 --> 03:43.710
So we are ready to build the sote and in the next lesson we're going to continue to build out what our

03:43.710 --> 03:44.890
question is going to look like.

03:44.940 --> 03:48.430
We've got the core mechanics of the game set up and ready to go.

03:48.510 --> 03:54.080
So we've got scoring we've got an output area for the question and we need to generate.

03:54.120 --> 03:59.280
So we're going to generate all of these questions and answers and then we're going to add an event listener

03:59.280 --> 04:04.590
to listen for the click and then we're going to check to see if the correct answer was selected and

04:04.590 --> 04:09.750
if it is then we're going to score one for correct and if it was wrong then we'll score one for wrong

04:09.840 --> 04:11.710
and that's how we're going to keep score there.

04:11.760 --> 04:16.440
And next we just have to build out what the going to look like within that output element.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.060
So it's coming up.
