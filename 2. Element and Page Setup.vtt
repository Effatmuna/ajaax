00:00.510 --> 00:07.530
First of that we need to do is set up a way to trigger our AJAX call so we can do that with a button.

00:07.530 --> 00:10.080
There's a number of ways that we can do this.

00:10.080 --> 00:15.390
So this is going to be a regular standard button we'll give it an ID so we can identify it.

00:15.390 --> 00:20.240
So give an idea of Beati and and it'll say click me.

00:21.840 --> 00:29.140
And next let's hook up our javascript so the javascript is going to be what connects to the API.

00:29.340 --> 00:31.740
Post back all of that information.

00:31.740 --> 00:40.550
And first of all let's add in our button and add an event listener to that variable between document.

00:40.770 --> 00:46.540
We can do get element by ID because we've got an ID of BT.

00:46.710 --> 00:51.910
So we just grab this last one and place it within the object.

00:51.930 --> 00:58.400
And now let's add our event listener and the listener that we're going to listen for is a click.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.850
And when it gets clicked then we're going to fire off a function.

01:04.200 --> 01:11.240
Next item let's set up our function so function.

01:11.270 --> 01:15.690
Next item we don't need to pass any parameters.

01:18.060 --> 01:22.490
And this one here is where all of the action is going to take place.

01:23.430 --> 01:27.310
So first of all let's just make sure that it's working.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.170
We'll open up our dev tools.

01:30.300 --> 01:33.160
Click the button and we see that it's clicked.

01:33.210 --> 01:41.460
So we're ready to go to continue to build this out and let's build out our request to build out a method

01:41.580 --> 01:50.480
where we're going to contain all of our Ajax functionality so set up our ex-teacher object will create

01:50.540 --> 01:56.400
a brand new one so this is SML HTP request object.

01:57.230 --> 02:01.270
And we also need to specify a method here.

02:01.550 --> 02:07.250
And then you are l as well as we want to load asynchronously so that's true.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.190
And actually char send.

02:11.480 --> 02:19.370
So now our exit char has been sent and we need to still listen to the ready state change

02:23.250 --> 02:31.390
so on ready state change that we want to fire off or we're going to create a function for that one.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.180
And let's do.

02:33.240 --> 02:40.070
SH are object so within this next item function we need to specify.

02:40.110 --> 02:49.020
L all so excited in your l and let's grab one of these API is just one of these endpoints and post it

02:49.030 --> 02:55.130
in and then we need to pass in a you are well within the parameters of the function refresh.

02:55.140 --> 02:56.000
Click the button.

02:56.100 --> 02:57.280
We see that it's clicked.

02:57.300 --> 03:03.480
We're not actually outputting it or making the request so it's odd that in and refresh and try again.

03:03.660 --> 03:05.730
So we see that we go through all of the ready States.

03:05.730 --> 03:07.530
So there's one two three four.

03:07.590 --> 03:08.730
So all of them get hit.

03:08.760 --> 03:09.820
As it changes.

03:09.900 --> 03:15.510
And on the last one we actually get response information and then this is what we want to make use of

03:15.570 --> 03:19.770
within our age to mail pieces the content that's coming back.

03:19.860 --> 03:20.980
So the next lesson.

03:21.090 --> 03:23.300
Let's dive deeper into the application.

03:23.310 --> 03:26.330
So go ahead and set this up for yourself within your own web page.

03:26.340 --> 03:31.230
And next we're going to be showing you how you can make use of the data that we're requesting and retrieving

03:31.230 --> 03:31.560
back.

03:31.560 --> 03:32.230
So it's coming up.
