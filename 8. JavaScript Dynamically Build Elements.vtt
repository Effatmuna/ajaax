This lesson we're going to focus on javascript and build out all of those answer elements.

00:06.530 --> 00:08.970
It's a very creative function in order to do that.

00:09.000 --> 00:19.640
We can get rid of a console log in over here what we can do is just create a for loop and because we've

00:19.700 --> 00:28.460
added in all of those values into holder we're going to loop through the length of holder and increment

00:28.550 --> 00:32.920
X and then every time we loop through though we need to create another element.

00:33.290 --> 00:43.190
So it's great var elements document and the method that we're using to create elements is create and

00:43.190 --> 00:45.260
let's create some divs.

00:45.290 --> 00:49.070
We're also going to do a value for checker.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.370
So it's a variable and do a tear unary operator.

00:52.370 --> 00:56.670
So this is where we're actually going to check to see if the value is correct.

00:56.690 --> 01:01.920
So as we're looping through the holder array we know that we're already holding the correct value in

01:01.970 --> 01:02.600
C..

01:02.630 --> 01:07.040
And the variable sealer so I'll check to see if they match.

01:07.310 --> 01:10.480
And if they do then we know that it's true.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.330
Otherwise it's false.

01:14.140 --> 01:18.480
And that's the value that we can pass into the attribute into the element.

01:18.650 --> 01:23.630
And when we clicked the element We'll check the attribute to see if it's true or false if it's true

01:23.720 --> 01:25.430
that we know that we got the correct answer.

01:25.430 --> 01:27.850
Otherwise it's going to be false and it's incorrect.

01:29.030 --> 01:36.740
So now going back to the element that we created a sort we need to set attribute and the attribute name

01:36.740 --> 01:40.500
is going to be data correct.

01:40.530 --> 01:42.010
You can call it whatever you want.

01:42.440 --> 01:51.310
And we're going to passen the value of checker in their Also let's do element inner h to Mel.

01:52.010 --> 01:57.820
And here we're just going to pass in whatever value is within holder.

01:57.960 --> 02:01.520
And then lastly we also had to have those event listeners.

02:01.740 --> 02:06.900
So let's attach that event listener and this is one of the reasons why we couldn't do it the same way

02:06.900 --> 02:14.010
we did the question the category because we needed the ability to have these event listeners registered.

02:14.070 --> 02:19.080
So we're going to do is we're going to send that answer whenever it gets clicked.

02:19.110 --> 02:22.750
And then lastly we just need to append the value.

02:23.010 --> 02:34.680
So we already have the location in cell answer so we need to just append child and that child is going

02:34.680 --> 02:36.060
to be the element that we just created.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.390
So it's that freshly created element.

02:38.820 --> 02:39.580
So I think we're ready.

02:39.630 --> 02:43.260
Let's take a look and see if we actually build some buttons.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.350
And of course they don't look like buttons quite yet but we're going to rely on styling for that.

02:48.510 --> 02:53.500
When we look at the HD M-L we see that we've got false true false false.

02:53.550 --> 02:56.090
So the correct answer for this one is there.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.200
So everything is working properly.

02:58.410 --> 03:02.880
And also when we click it we're grabbing all of that element information.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.080
See that's the data core is what we need to check to see.

03:07.170 --> 03:08.420
True or false.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.720
So let's add that in as well.

03:11.780 --> 03:18.500
So right now we're just logging out that event object and we can also just as easily grab the element

03:18.590 --> 03:21.390
attribute so we can do get attribute.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.870
And we already know the attribute that we're looking for.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.350
So data core.

03:25.550 --> 03:27.130
And then this will pick up the value.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.060
So this now it should say true or false.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.960
So a click on any of these we see false false.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.850
True.

03:33.860 --> 03:34.930
So there we go.

03:34.940 --> 03:41.420
So we're ready to continue on to our next step and actually increased out of scoring mechanism.

03:41.420 --> 03:46.580
So if they are true and these are actually going to be string values they're unfortunate they're not

03:46.580 --> 03:52.560
boolean values because they're coming through as an attribute and the attributes are strings.

03:52.580 --> 03:59.600
So we're going to have to just check them as string values and you could actually have any values you

03:59.600 --> 04:04.160
want in there you could have number values as well but they're all going to be coming in as strings.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.410
So now it's up to you.

04:05.420 --> 04:14.030
So open up your editor and do this update where you're building out an element on the fly within the

04:14.030 --> 04:15.610
question builder function.

04:15.830 --> 04:21.440
And next we're going to wrap this up where we're going to add in the scoring and then later we'll apply

04:21.440 --> 04:23.800
some styling to make those actually look like buttons.
