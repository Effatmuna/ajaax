00:00.520 --> 00:07.230
Get an opportunity to make your Ajax request next step is to make this more dynamic so we want to pick

00:07.230 --> 00:16.240
up the value of this input and pass it along into our Ajax request so let's create a brand new function.

00:17.030 --> 00:21.660
And because ultimately we want to have a number of different functions and all of these functions are

00:21.660 --> 00:23.390
going to be doing AJAX calls.

00:23.520 --> 00:29.020
So this one is going to be doing just a regular javascript function.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.650
So putting all of that information into javascript.

00:32.800 --> 00:38.770
And that's what we're going to actually load this information because within the make request when we

00:38.770 --> 00:45.220
clean this up a bit within the make request we need to account and we need to pick up the or else we

00:45.220 --> 00:46.780
can pass it within the function.

00:46.930 --> 00:51.310
So it's going to be one of the parameters that we're going to pass through is you are l and we can get

00:51.310 --> 00:54.340
rid of that over here because we're going to be passing it into the function.

00:56.890 --> 01:03.650
And what we want to do is we actually want to pick up the value of the URL from our input over here.

01:03.670 --> 01:05.110
So let's do that.

01:05.830 --> 01:12.870
So variable you are l and documents we use Querrey selector again.

01:15.170 --> 01:26.690
So Querrey selector and selecting that value will do in put name equals Ural and then we don't need

01:26.690 --> 01:28.460
to do anything else with that object.

01:28.460 --> 01:30.080
So it just pick up the value there.

01:31.240 --> 01:38.290
And next we're ready to pass it into our function so irritable person that you are well into the function.

01:38.290 --> 01:39.720
So let's try that out.

01:39.820 --> 01:43.140
So a little minor change but it's going to make us more dynamic.

01:43.390 --> 01:47.650
So this way we can actually change the different values there.

01:47.650 --> 01:52.460
So if I change users to three we get user 3 if I change user to 4.

01:52.630 --> 01:58.120
So we're getting whatever you are elsewhere we're putting here and we're getting that output into our

01:58.120 --> 01:59.420
interface.

01:59.420 --> 02:08.110
Another thing that I wanted to add into our project is a really nice output within the the web page.

02:08.260 --> 02:13.210
So instead of having it show up within the console it's going to be nice if we can just see the output

02:13.420 --> 02:16.830
directly within our Web page so we don't even have to open up our con..

02:16.870 --> 02:21.400
So let's create that and we'll create a div.

02:21.400 --> 02:29.560
Call it output and let's make this bigger so we can see the entire content.

02:29.830 --> 02:33.160
And I get to create another function that's going to actually do the output.

02:33.160 --> 02:42.630
And this is going to give me the ability to call this function from my Ajax requests and output some

02:42.630 --> 02:50.220
content into there so that we we know that once we break out of this request the response text is only

02:50.220 --> 02:54.320
available within this condition here and we're not returning it anywhere.

02:54.330 --> 02:59.730
So I wanted to make use of it and actually pull it out into the output so we can do that within this

02:59.730 --> 03:01.100
type of format.

03:01.500 --> 03:06.550
So do output and let's passen some parameters.

03:08.100 --> 03:16.800
So some of the parameters that maybe we want to pass in is the response text so call it response text.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.180
We also maybe want to pass in a status.

03:20.850 --> 03:29.740
And then lastly maybe we want to pass in some H.R. object information and then with an output let's

03:29.980 --> 03:34.570
grab we'll put output into a variable.

03:34.670 --> 03:43.160
So output documents and query selector we can do get element by ID for this one.

03:43.310 --> 03:44.590
Let's do something different.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.060
So get element by id the ID is output.

03:48.110 --> 03:52.820
We don't have to specify the hash because we already know that it is an ID that we're looking for.

03:55.120 --> 04:03.320
And then let's put in our H T and L and equal that to the response text.

04:03.460 --> 04:07.870
And we know that the response text actually is going to be in an object format.

04:07.870 --> 04:13.430
So if we try to output that directly into a web page it's not going to look nice.

04:13.450 --> 04:14.930
So we need to string a fight.

04:14.980 --> 04:22.190
So let's string ify our response text and see what that looks like.

04:24.050 --> 04:29.440
So now we could probably minimize this we still will need our consul for a little bit longer.

04:29.660 --> 04:37.180
But there we go so we see that we're we're actually not passing that information into output quite yet.

04:37.250 --> 04:47.240
So let's update that and to put the first parameter passing in is the response text.

04:47.310 --> 04:50.110
We can also passen are actually our status.

04:50.130 --> 04:58.610
So we get a number there and then this one we can do something like success so we can just pass our

04:58.610 --> 04:59.840
own message into it.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.990
So refresh and let's try that out.

05:02.120 --> 05:02.570
So there we go.

05:02.570 --> 05:08.740
So we're actually outputting that content directly into our web page in a readable format.

05:10.240 --> 05:16.630
And we know that this is coming in as a string value so we don't have to string a fly it again.

05:16.750 --> 05:23.140
And if it's not coming within a string format because some of the libraries we're going to work with

05:23.140 --> 05:26.560
are all about automatically going to convert this into a sun object.

05:26.590 --> 05:28.210
So this could be problematic.

05:28.330 --> 05:30.750
So let's do a little quick fix for that.

05:31.480 --> 05:37.010
So open up our editor and we know that we're getting that content coming in here.

05:37.300 --> 05:42.150
So let's check to see if response text.

05:42.400 --> 05:51.440
And we're going to do a quick check to see if type of this will be one word.

05:51.450 --> 05:56.070
So type of response text.

05:56.400 --> 06:04.900
So if that is equal to a string that we know that it's a string value and we don't have to we don't

06:04.900 --> 06:06.230
have to do anything else with it.

06:06.230 --> 06:10.410
We can just leave it as a string value and if it isn't a string.

06:10.550 --> 06:13.940
So if it's coming in as an object then let's do something with it.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.370
We're going to parse that in.

06:15.440 --> 06:19.940
So do Jaison parse.

06:20.130 --> 06:27.390
So over here what's happening here is if it's coming in and if it's a string then we're going to actually

06:27.390 --> 06:31.530
turn it into an object so that our string of file will work in all cases.

06:31.530 --> 06:36.710
And if Over here it's not a string then we're just going to keep it as is.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.360
And then we're going to string a fight in the output.

06:39.690 --> 06:46.170
So that way we have uniform output and that will get rid of all of those backslashes as well.

06:46.410 --> 06:49.560
So there we go so we can see that that data is being pulled through.

06:49.590 --> 06:52.200
We get our information.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.580
Let's try a different value.

06:53.640 --> 06:54.150
So there we go.

06:54.150 --> 07:01.730
So everything is being output properly and we could also output our status as well.

07:01.770 --> 07:06.880
So it's build data into the application so we know that we're grabbing this information.

07:06.880 --> 07:12.740
So it's going to be relatively easy to simply output that inner H T A L and add to it.

07:12.760 --> 07:20.840
So let's do that and we can do that with the and this one is going to be status.

07:21.730 --> 07:24.970
And then also let's do the last one as well.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.550
So the student ex-teacher.

07:28.920 --> 07:33.620
So even if they're strings we string of them and it looks like they're all going to be strings anyway.

07:33.720 --> 07:39.000
So we're going to string of find them anyway so there's no harm in having this type of format.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.920
Either way it's going to be returned as Jason and also I just wanted to quickly add before we go back

07:45.920 --> 07:49.540
into our age to Mel let's add some styling here.

07:49.580 --> 07:55.340
So it's to span class and I'll give a class of heading

07:57.910 --> 08:04.460
and we'll label it response text so we can actually see what it is.

08:04.480 --> 08:13.510
Know what it is and maybe the side sign data will just output as a paragraph then we need to close off

08:13.720 --> 08:19.810
the HGA now and close off the def and that should be good.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.790
Let's do the same thing for the other ones as well.

08:23.890 --> 08:28.410
So I'm going to just do a quick copy and paste and then we'll update it afterwards.

08:29.050 --> 08:33.690
So this one isn't response text it's status.

08:34.180 --> 08:37.170
And of course you can style it however you want.

08:39.960 --> 08:45.360
And we'll just call this one response because this one we've kind of kept open.

08:45.390 --> 08:48.300
We're over here we're just putting a string value there.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.910
So it just gives us a number of different options of how we can do it.

08:51.910 --> 08:59.710
We might want to just put javascript response so that we know where it's coming from.

08:59.710 --> 09:02.000
Also let's do some quick styling.

09:02.050 --> 09:07.750
I don't want to focus too much time on styling but it'll just make a nicer experience when that content

09:07.750 --> 09:08.890
is being output.

09:09.010 --> 09:10.880
So excited that styling.

09:11.440 --> 09:16.010
So we added in classic headings for those spans.

09:16.520 --> 09:27.480
So within here let's display it as a block and let's give it a width of 100 a quick border so it picks

09:27.500 --> 09:29.490
solid block.

09:30.280 --> 09:38.170
And of course you can customize however you want it to look I give a little bit of color and let's do

09:38.170 --> 09:39.050
the text.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.820
What do the text wait.

09:41.080 --> 09:48.210
And we also want to grab those divs that have a paragraph and let's apply some style into those paragraphs.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.760
And to some something quick.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.090
So it just stands out.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.650
So let's try check this out see what it looks like.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.160
So go back refresh.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.150
And so there we go.

10:02.150 --> 10:08.610
So we got a response text our status and our response content we can actually make this a little bit

10:08.610 --> 10:09.960
smaller as well.

10:11.650 --> 10:13.750
So we can see everything that's coming in.

10:13.900 --> 10:14.470
So great.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.830
So we're ready to move on to the next lesson.

10:16.840 --> 10:22.660
We've got some information coming in there and we know that whenever we update it this will update as

10:22.660 --> 10:23.750
well.

10:23.830 --> 10:25.400
So we see all of that.

10:25.430 --> 10:30.840
Jason Jason we see the status and we see where we sent it.

10:30.850 --> 10:35.610
So javascript actually our object was the one that returned this response.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.250
So go ahead.

10:36.270 --> 10:37.370
Try this out for yourself.

10:37.380 --> 10:43.560
Update your code in order to make it more dynamic picking up that you are Ehle information and then

10:43.620 --> 10:46.010
outputting it within your web page.

10:46.030 --> 10:51.300
So coming up next we're going to spice things up a little bit and we're going to bring in some of the

10:51.300 --> 10:51.860
libraries.

10:51.900 --> 10:58.930
You've got Jay Querrey Ajax and we're also going to be doing acquiesce as well as we're going to be

10:58.930 --> 11:00.110
using fetch as well.

11:00.130 --> 11:01.330
So all of this is coming up.
