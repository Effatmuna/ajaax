00:01.090 --> 00:04.900
So it's create a function in order to determine what the correct answer is.

00:04.900 --> 00:06.580
So do function.

00:06.580 --> 00:09.820
Correct answer is.

00:10.830 --> 00:15.340
And we don't need to pass any parameters because they're all going to be sitting within these elements.

00:15.370 --> 00:18.610
So all we need to do is simply loop through these elements

00:21.500 --> 00:30.380
and let's grab them document we'll use query selector all and we're going to grab all of the divs that

00:30.440 --> 00:33.710
are within that select answers.

00:33.740 --> 00:43.830
We do it the same way as we see here within our c us and lots of console log.

00:43.850 --> 00:55.910
So before we loop through them all and let's grab this one here and whenever we click an answer will

00:55.910 --> 01:00.450
see that we can loop through all those elements and put them into the console.

01:02.710 --> 01:06.810
And this should actually be the full function there.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.690
So we loop through the node list

01:13.460 --> 01:18.520
and if we've got more than one we can see that are note list is all four.

01:18.530 --> 01:19.960
So we're grabbing all four of those.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.400
So now it's just a matter of checking the attributes on each and every one of those.

01:24.620 --> 01:27.160
So we can loop through all the elements.

01:27.890 --> 01:37.120
Let's do good old fashioned for loop for X equals zero and we're going to loop while Elle's length

01:41.120 --> 01:45.220
and then increment x.

01:45.410 --> 01:48.410
So here what we need to do is we need to check

01:51.380 --> 01:55.530
what the value of that particular element is.

01:55.730 --> 02:01.170
And if the attribute is so do get attribute

02:04.800 --> 02:08.370
so first would just make sure that we're actually Graben although attributes.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.440
So see there we've got false true false false.

02:11.470 --> 02:13.530
So that's working.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.800
Let's turn this into a condition.

02:15.950 --> 02:20.610
So if and this is a string value again.

02:20.610 --> 02:22.370
So just keep that in mind.

02:24.540 --> 02:32.580
So if it's true then we can just return and we can return whatever the value is of this particular element

02:32.580 --> 02:34.920
whatever that enraged MLS.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.770
And we'll just do it in a text

02:42.820 --> 02:46.610
and over here let's say console log out our response

02:49.530 --> 02:50.570
so we can actually see it.

02:50.610 --> 02:55.180
So click click one of these Avatar is correct.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.490
So it doesn't matter which when we click we're getting the correct one.

02:58.500 --> 02:58.980
So there we go.

02:58.990 --> 03:01.780
So that's how we can figure out what the correct answer is.

03:01.950 --> 03:10.020
So now we can what we can do is we can overwrite all of these elements so overwrite all of the options

03:10.020 --> 03:14.880
and just say correct answer was or wrong correct answer was whatever.

03:15.270 --> 03:16.570
So let's do that then.

03:20.050 --> 03:24.520
And maybe what we'll do is we'll pull the Selecta answers put it globally

03:27.130 --> 03:36.170
and within here what we can do is we can just wipe out whatever value is contained within there.

03:36.340 --> 03:41.620
So select answer enter h to Moul and then equal that to whatever our messages

03:44.270 --> 03:54.370
so great or we can do correct bunch of explanation marks and score is equal to that.

03:57.480 --> 04:09.570
The other option is that we want to grab this and say wrong it was and then here is where we want to

04:09.570 --> 04:14.740
get the correct answer.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.120
So it's too variable

04:21.580 --> 04:28.610
so a correct answer value is within this function.

04:28.860 --> 04:33.880
And the reason I'm doing it up here is because see over here we're overwriting that enraged him.

04:33.990 --> 04:36.060
So it's not really that great.

04:36.090 --> 04:39.680
That's not the right time to really make that function.

04:40.850 --> 04:42.250
So we'll see what happens.

04:42.490 --> 04:46.410
So have any known living species of hyenas are there.

04:46.410 --> 04:47.530
So do six.

04:47.560 --> 04:51.350
Wrong it was for true or false wrong.

04:51.370 --> 04:52.490
It was true.

04:52.810 --> 04:54.460
So I'm not doing too great.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.190
Correct.

05:00.840 --> 05:05.170
And we could also add in that correct answer there as well.

05:05.340 --> 05:07.310
So it always does and doesn't hurt.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.830
And you can even do even more you can add in some styling.

05:10.850 --> 05:15.570
Make it read make it whatever green for correct for wrong.

05:15.660 --> 05:20.460
So now it's up to you so you've got a fully functioning application.

05:20.470 --> 05:22.350
We should also move this button.

05:22.510 --> 05:27.460
Maybe we could move it to the top or to the bottom because it doesn't really look that great there or

05:27.460 --> 05:38.250
maybe we could hide it and then show it whenever where we're ready to click for more.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.150
So whenever it gets clicked.

05:40.180 --> 05:48.230
So whenever button gets clicked we fire off and there really is just always things that you can do.

05:48.270 --> 05:50.560
Always things that you can add an update.

05:51.230 --> 06:02.460
So let's update the display properties for the button so that style display and we'll set it to none.

06:03.110 --> 06:08.750
And then over here once they make a selection then we'll set it back to block.

06:08.750 --> 06:14.560
So once we do correct answer we're going to give them the option to continue the game.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.670
And over here we'll just set it to block.

06:18.680 --> 06:23.450
So all of this is going to do is this is just a little bit of a tweak on the application just to make

06:23.450 --> 06:24.930
it a little bit more functional.

06:24.980 --> 06:28.370
So that actually disappears so they can't just keep hitting next next next.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.450
They actually have to answer the question.

06:30.560 --> 06:38.370
So whatever they answer then they get the option to click the button and questions are pretty much and

06:38.390 --> 06:43.020
less and keeping score up here.

06:43.100 --> 06:45.220
So you can have a lot of fun with API.

06:45.380 --> 06:49.740
And this is just one example of some of the really cool things you can do with API.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.810
So go ahead try this for yourself.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.710
Update the code and definitely add some styling.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.240
Make it look a whole lot better.
