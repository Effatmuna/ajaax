With the upcoming lessons we're going to be working through a number of exercises to build out and make

00:05.970 --> 00:08.190
use of various web API.

00:08.370 --> 00:14.460
And then pull that content through and use that within our application so you can see here.

00:14.460 --> 00:18.120
Here's an example of one of the applications that we're going to be building out.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.460
It uses a quiz database.

00:20.580 --> 00:26.680
It connects to the database and we generate all of the stuff here dynamically with Javascript.

00:26.790 --> 00:32.880
So that includes these buttons here for the answers which give us the ability to click and detect if

00:32.880 --> 00:33.980
it was right or wrong.

00:34.080 --> 00:41.730
Also load additional questions and continue and we're also keeping track score with correct and wrong

00:41.760 --> 00:42.670
answers.

00:42.690 --> 00:48.960
So it's connected to a database that continuously loads more different questions and we've got categories

00:48.960 --> 00:55.140
for questions type of questions booleans multiple choice and also then of course the question and then

00:55.140 --> 00:56.220
we've got the correct answer.

00:56.220 --> 01:01.540
So this is coming into the console and we've done a little bit of styling to make it more presentable.

01:01.770 --> 01:06.050
So this is just one of the many API that are available online.

01:06.060 --> 01:11.000
And to truly become familiar with API is it's a great opportunity to work with them.

01:11.010 --> 01:12.300
Try it for yourself.

01:12.300 --> 01:18.270
Bring the content into your javascript and put it within the page within an application type format.

01:18.300 --> 01:23.580
So it's going to be a great learning experience to find out more about what Ajax can do and how to work

01:23.580 --> 01:27.270
with Jaison data that gets returned back from these various API.

01:27.500 --> 01:30.750
And making use of it within your web applications.

01:30.930 --> 01:39.110
We're also going to look at a few other API and work through various challenges that developers will

01:39.110 --> 01:42.730
have working with Ajax in Javascript.

01:42.770 --> 01:49.220
So all of this is coming up soon when you're ready let's jump right in and start building out this application

01:49.220 --> 01:50.070
from scratch.
